-- TODO: add "discharge equipment" after teleport
-- TODO: When the setting "All teleporters available" is true, then the Teleporter GUI should show all Cities.
-- TODO: Remove the map tag 'ping' when a teleport happens. (this will be annoying and spammy in a multiplayer game.)
-- TODO: When a teleporter doesn't have enough power, only disabling the button isn't good enough.  It needs some visual indicator why it isn't working.  I used the floating text.
-- TODO: (new) On the Map View, change the icon for the Rocket Silo to be the Rocket Silo. (not the teleporter UI)

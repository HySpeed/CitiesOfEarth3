-- TODO: BUG: Mexico City (Americas) and Hampi (Olde) [India] did not get created.  Logs show they were.  Also, with setting of "All Available" to true, the cities did not show up on the Teleporter UI.
-- TODO: FEATURE: When a teleporter doesn't have enough power, only disabling the button isn't good enough.  It needs some visual indicator why it isn't working.  I used the floating text.
---TODO: FEATURE: Allow for global silo settings adjustment (launches per death etc)
-- REVW: REQUEST: Teleporter UI: Display a different icon for "unrevealed" teleporters.  We could use the 'empty' that used to be the default.

-- TODO: Spike: Refactor WorldGen decompressed data.  Determine if there is a way to speed up terrain generation.
